# WorldVetter
Vet text on signs for Minecraft worlds exported by MCC Toolchest

This project depends on MCC ToolChest to create the necessary files at the moment. Simply open your world in MCC Toolchest and go to `Tools > Misc > NBT to Text` and export to a new folder. Then open up that folder in Vetter.
