    This program is meant to work with MCC Toolchest PE, which is a free download. You only need to open up the world in MCC, and under Tools > Misc > NBT to Text,
    then choose a folder to put all that data in. Wait until you get a message that says it has completed. From there, you may close MCC Toolchest and, in this program,
    click Open Folder. Select the folder you exported to and click Open Folder. It will then either show the name of your world and some general information, or an error.
    Then, click "Begin Vetting". This will go through the files you exported and give you a list of every sign, what it says, and a /tp coordinate to it's location.
